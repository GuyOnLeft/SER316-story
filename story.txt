Once upon a time in Berlin, there was a Bratwurst that dreamed of owning a BMW.
But working at a Baeckerei in Munich it could only afford an Audi.
With its new Audi it invited his friend Brot to ride through Berlin.
The Bratwurst was blasting its Musik through Berlin.
Brot and Bratwurst listened to Rammstein while they rode through Berlin.
As it was summer, Bratwurst needed to use a Klimaanlage in his house and schloss his windows.
With his best Lederhose on, the Bratwurst got out of his car to apply for a loan to buy his new BMW, but a Hund nearby lunged in for a taste.
Luckily the Hund only got a piece of the Bratwurt's Dirndel, and Schloss the car door in the process.
A thought came to Bratwursts mind, is dreaming of owning a BMW causing these bad things to occur?
Bratwurst wrapped it`self in a Brot and braced for impact. Bratwurst leaped from the BMW and tumbled down the Hauptstrasse.
He made out with only a few minor rips in his bratwurst casing. The next day he went to Flughafen and left the country for good.
He then happened to appear inside of a Klimaanlage of an American household, which is not that different from temperatures in Berlin.
But the Bratwurst was wettbewerbsfaehig so it returned back to Berlin, only to be eaten by Dr. Mehlhase and to never have gotten his BMW
