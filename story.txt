Once upon a time in Berlin, there was a Bratwurst that dreamed of owning a BMW.
But working at a Baeckerei in Munich it could only afford an Audi.
With its new Audi it invited his friend Brot to ride through Berlin.
The Bratwurst was blasting its Musik through Berlin.
Brot and Bratwurst listened to Rammstein while they rode through Berlin.
As it was summer, Bratwurst needed to use a Klimaanlage in his house and schloss his windows.
With his best Lederhose on, the Bratwurst got out of his car to apply for a loan to buy his new BMW, but a Hund nearby lunged in for a taste.
